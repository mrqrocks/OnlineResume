<h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>Summary</u></h2>
<p>Hi I'm Mike, or Michael happy with either name, 
    I have recently moved to the Southport to start a family with my partner.
    I have knowledge of software, hardware and peripherals learnt by completing Google's IT fundamentals and my grandad who taught me some html,
    basic and how to build PC's and install software, 
    I always like to think outside the box and have a creative mind with qualifications in BTEC's in Art and Design, Media and Performing Arts. In my free time I love playing online games with freinds, 
    photography, cooking and spending time with my partner and son.
